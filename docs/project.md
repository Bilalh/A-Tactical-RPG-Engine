Title: A Tactical RPG Engine

Introduction 
============

A Tactical RPG is a grid based game (like chess) where each player has a number of units(pieces). The players taken turns to moves their units.  Each unit has attributes associated with it such as strength, and hit points that affect all the actions in the game. Like chess there are different kinds of units which  affects how the unit moves and what action they can perform. A unit can attack other player's units, the goal of the game is usually to defeat all the opponents units.   

The aim of this project is to create a engine which will take resources such as graphics, sound and rules of the game to create a runnable Tactical RPG.

Objectives
==========

Primary 
-------
* A engine which take 
	* The  definition  of  character  attributes  and  a  magic/combat  system. 
	* The  definition  of  a  world  broken  up  into  the  smaller  environments.  
	* The  definition  of  simple  story  as  a  wrapper  for  the  whole  game  and  to
	manage  the  movement  between  environments  from  the  start  to  the
	conclusion  of  the  game

and create a playable tactic RPG. 

* a  set  of  behaviours  for  how  the  non-player characters  should  behave.z

Secondary
---------
* Tile `height`, where units can only move to tiles of a  smilier height.
* Tiles that are not passable such as sea, lava, etc.
* Tiles have different movement costs associated with them. 
* Isometric graphics.
* Long distance weapons/magic for player.
* Direction and height of the characters affects attack.
* Sound effects.
* Music.
* Saving and loading games.

Tertiary
--------
* Scripting support e.g to allow the user to defined winning conditions.
* AI support for Long distance weapons/magic.
* Creation of custom units and shops 
* `classes` of units which the AI supports.
* A graphical editor for making custom maps.
* Animations.


Ethics <!-- %(form by 28th October) -->
