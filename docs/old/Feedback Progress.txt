Feedback from Alexander Voss at 14/02/2012 11:39:The project seems to be going well and the results achieved so far are impressive. There do not seem to be any major problems, so the main thing to say is that you should prioritise the remaining work. Try to assess how much would would be involved in completing the different features that remain, what risks exist that might hinder progress and what dependencies might exist. The main aim should be to complete the code to an extent that the whole game building and gameplay experience can be demonstrated and an evaluation done for the dissertation. The quality of the AI is probably a secondary aim.
