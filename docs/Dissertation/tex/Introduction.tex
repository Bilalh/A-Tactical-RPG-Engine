An RPG (Role Playing Game) is a game where a player assumes the role of a character. An RPG is usually story driven and the character usually has a quest to complete. In the course of the game the player will go to different environments such as town and dungeons. In these environments the player will have to fight opponents in battles. Combat in RPGs is normally a simple turn based system where players and their opponents take turns to attack each other using various skills. 

A Tactical RPG is a sub-genre of an RPG that focuses on the combat side of the genre. A Tactical RPG is series of \texttt{battles}, which take place in various environments intertwined with an over-arching story.

Each \texttt{battle} is grid based (like chess) where each player has a number of units(pieces).

The players take turns to move their units. Each unit has attributes associated with it such as strength, and hit points that affect all the actions in the game. Like chess there are different kinds of units which affects how the unit moves and what action they can perform. A unit can attack other player's units, the goal of the battle is usually to defeat all the opponents units.

The aim of this project is to create an engine which will take resources such as graphics, sounds and rules of the game to create a runnable Tactical RPG.
