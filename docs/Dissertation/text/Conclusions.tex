\section{Conclusions}


\subsection{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Improvement to levelling up. 
	Usually a unit does not have access to all of its skills at the beginning of the game, but it gains access to them when levelling up.  This would make the produced game  more balanced, since only skills appropriate to the unit stats could be used.

\item Implementation of an overworld map with a battle occurring at each location. This would allow the user to choose which map to play.  A good use of this would be a branching storyline where the plot is changed depending on which maps the player plays.
 
\item  Better AI

\item Scripted Events


\end{itemize}

Allows the user to preview the created game with exporting it.  This allow the user to test their game without having exporting each hence saving development time.  This engine partly supports this features (which was used for debugging), adding this to editor would be a significant improvement. In addition to allows the user to simulate a battle (e.g allowing specifying the attributes of the units such as their level)  would allow the user to quickly test any map in the game, which would be especially useful for long games.
