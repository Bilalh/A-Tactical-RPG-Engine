\section{Conclusions}


\subsection{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Improvement to levelling up. 
	Usually a unit does not have access to all of its skill at beginning, but gains access to them when levelling up.  This would make the produced game  more balanced, since only skill appropriate to the unit stats could be used.

\item Implementation of an overworld map with a battle happening at each location. This would allow the user to choose which map to play.  A good use of this would be a branching storyline where the plot is changed depending on which maps the player plays.
 
\item  Better Ai

\item Scripted Events

\end{itemize}
