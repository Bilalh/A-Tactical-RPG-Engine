\subsection{Editor}

\subsubsection{Exporting}

The editor can export a project as completed  package, either as a Mac OS X application or as jar. These application don't requires a any extural resources, expent for a recent version of java \footnote{specifily Java 1.6+}.

A notable feature of the editor is that jar will work on any java enable platform, since the jar contains all requires libaries for each platform. The OS X application can even be export on other platforms.

While most of the testing was done on OS X \footnote{Mac OS X  10.6 Snow leopard}, it also works well on Linux \footnote{Science  Linux x.y}. Its even has some  compatibly with Windows\footnote{Tested on Windows 7 32 bit} (apart from some minor graphics issues).
