\subsection{Project Scope}
\label{sub:project_scope}

The aim of the project is to allow the user a highly customisable Tactical RPG.  There are three main parts to the project the \emph{engine}, the \emph{GUI} and the \emph{editor}.

The engine will contains all the logic of the game including the progression as well as the battle system. The GUI, will be an isometric view of the game (see Section~\ref{sub:tilemap}). 

The editor will allows the user to customise the input to engine. This includes visual map making as well as specify all the attributes of the units and weapons.  The editor also allows the user to export the game as a standalone application.
