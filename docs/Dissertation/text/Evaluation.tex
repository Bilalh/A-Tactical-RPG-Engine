\subsection{Results of User Testing}

\subsubsection{System usability scale}
System usability scale (SUS) was used \cite{SUS}. This works by giving even numbered questions a score of (5 - \emph{value}) and odd numbered questions a score of of (\emph{value}-1). Questions that contributed a high score show that the system is usable. 

Based on this schema, the maximum positive contribution is four. To the overall usability score the sum of the questions' contributions is multiplied by 2.5 

\subsubsection{Results}
In total six people predicated in the usability survey. The usability result was 61. This is very good result since a score of 50 mean that the system is useable. 

\subsubsection{Analysis}
Since no score was below two the system had most of the features the users wanted.
