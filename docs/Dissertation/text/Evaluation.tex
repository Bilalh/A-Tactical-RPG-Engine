\section{Evaluation and Critical Appraisal}

\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sub:eobjectives}
The objectives as listed in section \ref{sub:objectives}  are extensive, ranging from primary objectives that required a basic engine capable of creating a Tactical RPG to tertiary objectives which required the creation of a editor which customisable most aspects of the  engine. 

Since all the primary and secondly objectives were completed as well as nearly all the tertiary objectives I consider  the project a success, I will now discuss the objectives in details.

\subsubsection{Primary Objectives}

The primary objectives focus on basic functionality of the engine, I have marked these objectives as completed. Notable improvements from the objectives include the engine handling the pagination and line wrapping of the dialog automatically which frees the user from fiddling with the dialog to make it fit on the screen.

Combat between units was as primary requirement, which was completed with many addition features, which are discussed later.

The primary requirements were to make an isometric graphical representation of the game, this was very successful. The view had useful features such allows the game to played with either the mouse of the keyboard.

\subsubsection{Secondary Objectives}
The main goal of the secondary objectives is to allow the user more customisability this   Associating attributes such as height and movement cost to tiles was requirement that was completed. In addition the engine support \emph{empty} tiles which they are impassable and not displayed to the user. This allows the creation of more complex maps as shown in figure \ref{fig:figures_editor_Map}. Another enhancement is that \emph{slated} tile can be used, they are tile that has a different start and end height and could be used for making stairs or cliffs. 

The secondary objectives required a combat that support the use of weapons and non-adjacent targets for both the player and the AI opponent. Weapon in particular deserve  mention since they are completely configurable. The engine of course provide default implementations of common weapon such as ranged weapons and spears (which shows the weapons can have extra effects such as attacking multiple targets). 

The default implementation  of the battle (User can use their own battle system, but its slightly complex) takes many attributes such as the units level and difference in height between the attack and the target to determine the outcome of a battle. 

I completed the objective of allowing music and sound effects, the format is used is Ogg Vorbis (Appendix \ref{sub:music}). In addition wave files can be used for sound effects, this was implemented since the format seems to commonly used for this purpose.

Save and loading the game time were implemented as required, but with the restriction that when a save file is loaded the player begin at the \emph{beginning} of the last played map.. 

Allowing the user to customising the AI behaviour, is a completed objective. In addition the engine provides default behaviour including the example of attack the player's unit with lowest HP. The engine also provides default actions such when moving to a faraway target, if the target is not reachable, most as close as possible and attack any player's unit that is in ranch. 

\subsubsection{Tertiary Objectives}
The main objectives of these requirements is to produce a editor that allowed customising most aspects of the engine as well as combat improvements and units animations, all them having being completed. 

Combat requirements improvements include \texttt{skills} that can affect multiple units, and weapons which can attack multiple units. Further enhancements to this system include complete customisable range (e.g could be used to attack all enemy units around the attack).

The requirement for animated unit movement was completed. This further improved by taking account of the direction the unit is traveling in, which was done by have a  image for each of the four directions. 

\paragraph{Editor\\}
A editor that can customise nearly all aspects of the engine was created.  The most prominent features are the visual map editor (section ref), unit creation(section ref), dialog editing(section ref) and exporting as a self contained application.  The editor met all the  tertiary requirements also had addition improvement. These include a easy to edit dialog format for importing/exporting and inter-compatibility  with Stasyk’s Terrain Generator to give a user a start point for their map designs.

\paragraph{Scripting \& Custom Events\\}
A tertiary requirements was to implement custom events though the use of scripting.  This would allow the user to specify events such as making the player win if some enemies unit has less then 50\% Hit Points. 

To implement this I had planed to use the Java Scripting API\cite{javas}. The would allow embedding a dynamic scripting language.  The main benefit of this, is that the code does not have to be compiled which means it does have the same hurdles with class linking as my Extension Mechanism(Appendix \ref{sub:data_format_extension_mechanism}).   The language chosen for embedding was Javascript  as it is build into the JDK, so the user does not have install anything extra and of all the scripting language Javascript  is more likely to have been used before by the average user, these design are described in more detail in section \ref{sec:Scripting}. 

Some people such as ref  advocate forgoing scripting completing. Pointing out that scripting is a lazy out of let user customisability since it can be quite for user to create events.  Using their advice of creating visual editors for creating events instead I allows the user to specify common events from the editor, with the option of link they own classes as a last resort. 

Although the scripting was not implementation due to time constraints, note that it was  tertiary objectives and all the example can be still be specified by editor. In particular win conditions can be specified (section ref) and common winning condition can even can be selected from the editor.  The engine support shows dialog at arbitrary point in the game which could be used to support the requirement ``Showing some part of the story when a player’s character reaches a specified tile''.

The engine supports the user using their own classes though the extension mechanism in Appendix \ref{sub:data_format_extension_mechanism}, which allows a slightly more limited form of scripting but with the benefit of being type safe but with the drawback of being  more complex.

\subsection{Results of User Testing}
\label{sub:results_of_user_testing}

In total six participants took part in the user testing, more people were interested but could not due to time constraints.  See Appendix \ref{sec:questionnaire} for the Questionnaire.

\subsection{Analysis of Responses}
The participants can be grouped into three groups, those who have played a TRPG before, those who have not and those who don't play games at all.
\paragraph{Feedback from  all groups\\}
Both groups thought the editor supported all the features they would like if they created a TRPG.  Most of the participants answered that they would like to use the editor again.  Interestingly, all users who were familiar with TRPG used the keyboard exclusively, this I attribute to participants being used to the input mechanism since most TRPG are on consoles\footnote{such as Playstation 2}. Those who had no experience playing TRPG unexpectedly used both the keyboard and mouse at the same time (generally selecting the units with the mouse then using the keyboard for performing any actions).

\paragraph{Feedback from those who had played a TRPG before\\}
Participants that had experience playing a TRPG before found the engine very intuitive. They especially liked how everything was customisable.  The visual map editor also gained significant praise for it's easy of use and it's range of features.  Other features that participants liked were how a project could be exported as a standalone Mac OS X application with virtually no effort. 

When playing the pre-created game, all of the participants were able to play, and even win, the game!. Some of the participants were able to figure out all of the out the controls with out even reading the help screen. 

\paragraph{Feedback from those who had not played a TRPG  before\\} 
In contrast, participants who never played a TRPG before felt overwhelmed with the available options, although they figured how to use it quite quickly.  They particularly liked how robust the editor was. The main features that were requested were  an overview of each feature in the editor and how they interacted.  The participants commented on the pleasing visual appearance of the editor.

When playing the pre-created game, some of the participants were initially confused by the interface. All participant were able to finish the game even if they could not win.  The participant unexpectedly kept on using the enter key to perform actions on the unit even though the help panel stated otherwise. In response to this feedback, I added the enter key as an alias of the action key(default `x').

\subsubsection{System usability scale}
A System Usability Scale (SUS) was used \cite{SUS}. This works by giving each even numbered questions a score of (5 - \emph{value}) and odd numbered questions a score of (\emph{value}-1). Questions that contributed to a high score showed that the system is usable. 

Based on this schema, the maximum positive contribution is four. To get the overall usability score, the sum of the questions contributions is multiplied by 2.5. 

\subsubsection{Results}
The usability result was 61. This is a very good result since a score of 50 means that the system is useable. 

\subsubsection{Analysis}
Since no individual question scored below two, the system has most of the features the users wanted.
