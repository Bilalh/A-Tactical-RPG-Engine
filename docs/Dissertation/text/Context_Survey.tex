\subsection{Evolution of Tactical RPGs }
\label{sub:evolution_of_tactical_rpgs_}

Classic Tactical RPGs(TRPGs)  were heavy influenced traditional Strategy games in particual chess.  The earliest game that shares the conspets of a TRPG is ``Bokosuka Wars''(1983) had many of features now common in TRPGs include grid based combat with a number of units\cite{BokosukaWars}\footnote{Tactical RPG also are called Simulation Strategy RPG(SRPG),  most commonly in Japan}. 

Although there many western games that had smilier gameplay at the time like ``Ultima III: Exodus''(1985), which is a traditional RPG with TRPG like battles, they quickly diverged and soon featured real time combat, or reverted to a simple combat system traditional RPG like ``Final Fantasy''.  This tread lead to most TRPG until recently be made in Japan since until recently western publishers  thought TRPGs were to niche to be profitable \cite{notrpg}. 

I will briefly describe  the games that made a significant contributions to the genre, these will be used later in evaluating the capabilities of the engine.

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item \emph{Fire Emblem}(1990), popularised the genre. The game induced RPG elements such as weapons, skills that became standard in later game. It also was also one of the first TRPG to have a non-trivial plot. 

	\item \emph{Tactics Ogre}(1994) the game which started the to have the name tactics in the game  which gave rise to the Tactical RPG name\footnotemark[\value{footnote}]\cite{tactics}. Unique feature for it's time include a isometric maps, a overworld map\footnote{A overworld map has a series of user selectable location, where the battle take place.} and  a branching storyline. It also popularised dynamic unit ordering that is determined by the character's attributes rather then each player moves all their units when its their turn.

	\item \emph{Final Fantasy Tactics}() properrly the most profulic TRPG in America/Europe. It featured a 3d viewpoint that imationed  the 2d isomeric view of previous games.  It allows the user to rotate the map which allowed less restricted maps\footnote{Older TRPG's maps could not be rotated hence they design that such tiles with greater height were at the far ends of the map. This was done to made sure that nothing was obstured}.
	
	\item  \emph{Disgaea: Hour of Darkness}(): The first in a series of game that had the unique feature allow the player to play random generated maps to improve replayabitlty. The latest in the series (``Disgaea 4'') is one of the few TRPGs that contain a map editor, which allow the player some limited customisable. 


	\item  \emph{Valkyria Chronicles}() started the tend of blurring tactics with other genres. The game played like a typical TRPG \emph{except} when attacking an opponent where it acts like a first person shooter.

	\item \texttt{Sim RPG Maker 95}, one of the few tactical RPG's engines
	\item \texttt{RPG Maker} which it is based off.
