\subsubsection{Test Driven Development}
Test Driven Development (TDD), has four main phases
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep ]
	\item Write a Test.
	\item Write the code to pass the test.
	\item Run all tests.
	\item Refractor
\end{itemize}

The major benefits of TDD are the system will be well tested. It also has the added benefit of allowing prevents new features from breaking the system. Combined with version control as discursed in the next section, it make very easy to find since the unit tests can be used to find \emph{when} the code broke as well as \texttt{which} piece of code was the root cause.

TDD was used when designing and implementing the model's algorithms such unit movement. 
  
Although TDD has many benefits it can effently used to test user interfaces, since a unit test can not simulate how a user would react to different aspects of the user interface.  Resulting from this I  did user studies as well usability studies to defects in the user interface.
