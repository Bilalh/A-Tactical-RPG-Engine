\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Improvement to Leveling up. 
	Usually the  unit does not have access to all of its skill, but gains access to them when levelling up.  This would make the game produced more balanced, since only skill approrbily to the unit stats would be used.

\item Implementation of a overworld map with a battle happening at each location. This would allow the user to choose which map to play.  An good use of this would be branching storyline where plot is changed depending on which maps the player plays.
 
\item  Better Ai

\item Scripted Events
