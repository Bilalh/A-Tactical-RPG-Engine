\subsection{Editor}
The editor is self contained application, requiring only Java 6+.  To run:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For the Mac OS X application click on it
	\item For the jar use \lstinline{java -jar 'Tactical Engine.jar'} (or click on it if using a Mac).
\end{itemize}

\noindent A new project can be created using \texttt{New Project}. To open an existing project click \texttt{open other} navigate to the directory of a project and select the \texttt{project.tacticalproject} file. Example projects are included in the \texttt{projects} directory.

The created game can exported from the file menu as either a Mac OS X application or a cross-platform jar.
