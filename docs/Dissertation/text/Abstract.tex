\begin{abstract}

Tactical RPGs(Role-playing Games) are games that are comprised of a series of battles that take place in various environments intertwined with an over-arching story. Battles are similar to the game of chess but include RPG elements. These includes attributes such as Hit Points which represents how much damage a piece can receive before being defeated.  The aim of this project is  to develop an engine that produces Tactical RPGs and affords the user a high degree of customisability. This is in addition to a isometric view of the battles and an editor which allows the user to visually specify aspects of the engine. This reports discusses the process of creating the system, starting from the objectives of the project, following on with the design and implementation.  A critical evaluation of the project, with respect to the context and original objectives, demonstrated its usability. The use of user testing and a example game is used to demonstrate the the project's capabilities.
