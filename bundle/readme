If replacing terrain_generator with a new version  you have to change the linker path for terrain_generator to statically link libyaml.


e.g  
install_name_tool -change '/usr/local/Cellar/libyaml/0.1.3/lib/libyaml-0.2.dylib' '@executable_path/libyaml-0.2.dylib'

if libyaml is installed in /usr/local/Cellar/libyaml/0.1.3/lib/libyaml-0.2.dylib
